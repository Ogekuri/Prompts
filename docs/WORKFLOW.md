## Execution Units

### `PROC:main`

- Entrypoint(s):
  - Prompt frontmatter declarations consumed by external runtime [`src/prompts/analyze.md`, `src/prompts/change.md`, `src/prompts/check.md`, `src/prompts/cover.md`, `src/prompts/create.md`, `src/prompts/fix.md`, `src/prompts/implement.md`, `src/prompts/new.md`, `src/prompts/readme.md`, `src/prompts/recreate.md`, `src/prompts/refactor.md`, `src/prompts/references.md`, `src/prompts/renumber.md`, `src/prompts/workflow.md`, `src/prompts/write.md`].
- Lifecycle/trigger:
  - Starts when an operator invokes the external prompt runtime with a selected prompt file.
- Executes the selected prompt steps with exact terminal strings that do not append bell-control suffixes; prompts that execute `req --git-wt-create <WORKTREE_NAME>` explicitly require deriving `<BASE_PATH>` via `req --get-base-path` and `<GIT_PATH>` via `req --git-path` before generating `<WORKTREE_NAME>` via `req --git-wt-name`; when workflows require values retrieved from commands for later reuse, the prompt instructions retain literal results, require literal `req` commands with simple sequential execution, and disallow shell-composed multi-step commands that use command substitution, backticks, indirect expansion, parameter transformation, nested substitution, or shell-derived helper composition; every step that executes `req --git-wt-create <WORKTREE_NAME>` explicitly requires `cd <GIT_PATH>/../<WORKTREE_NAME>` immediately after `req --git-wt-create <WORKTREE_NAME>` and before the next step; merge-preparation steps explicitly require deriving `<BASE_PATH>` via `req --get-base-path` when needed and executing `cd <BASE_PATH>` instead of `req --git-wt-exit`; prompts that do not execute `req --git-wt-create <WORKTREE_NAME>` do not declare `## Pre-requisite: Execution Context` and do not include `<WORKTREE_NAME>` generation via `req --git-wt-name`; every declared `Pre-requisite: Execution Context` section explicitly requires all listed context information to remain continuously available for the full workflow and never be dropped, forgotten, or overwritten; final repository-cleanliness verification uses `req --git-check` (not `git status --porcelain`); authorized early-termination branches after successful worktree creation use only explicit `req --git-wt-delete <WORKTREE_NAME>` cleanup before termination and do not include rollback or revert git-state commands (`git restore .`, `git checkout .`, `git clean -fd`), while pre-create branches, create-failure branches, and prompts without worktree creation do not use `req --git-wt-delete <WORKTREE_NAME>`; Stage & commit instructions explicitly state that a GPG-signed commit is not required; final report instructions preserve the fixed report schema and exact status line while explicitly targeting human readers with clear sentences and readable Markdown formatting; verification stages use requirement evidence plus `req --here --static-check`, treat `Error: no source files found in configured directories.` as successful no-source completion, execute existing unit tests only when relevant suites are present using language-specific test-suite priority policy, and for defect-fix workflow prefer a failing reproducer unit-test-first sequence before applying source fixes and require a three-column requirement-conflict table (`Requirement ID`, `Conflicting Excerpt`, `Conflict Reason + Interrupted Implementation Intent`) before the incompatible-requirements error termination branch; exits after workflow completion.
- Internal Call-Trace Tree:
  - No internal functions detected under `src/` or `.github/workflows`.
- External Boundaries:
  - External prompt runtime parses Markdown prompt artifacts and executes tool/shell instructions declared in prompt steps.
- Thread Model:
  - no explicit threads detected.

### `PROC:gha-check-branch`

- Entrypoint(s):
  - Workflow trigger `on.push.tags: v[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+` activates workflow run [`.github/workflows/release-markdown.yml`].
  - Job definition `check-branch` on `ubuntu-latest` [`.github/workflows/release-markdown.yml`].
- Lifecycle/trigger:
  - Starts as first job in workflow graph.
  - Performs checkout and branch-containment check for `${GITHUB_SHA}`.
  - Writes `is_master` output to `$GITHUB_OUTPUT`; exits.
- Internal Call-Trace Tree:
  - No internal functions detected under `src/` or `.github/workflows`.
- External Boundaries:
  - `actions/checkout@v4` action execution [`.github/workflows/release-markdown.yml`].
  - Shell + git boundary (`git fetch`, `git branch -r --contains`, `grep`) [`.github/workflows/release-markdown.yml`].
  - GitHub Actions output-file boundary (`$GITHUB_OUTPUT`) [`.github/workflows/release-markdown.yml`].
- Thread Model:
  - no explicit threads detected.

### `PROC:gha-build-release`

- Entrypoint(s):
  - Job definition `build-release` with dependency `needs: check-branch` and gate `if: needs.check-branch.outputs.is_master == 'true'` [`.github/workflows/release-markdown.yml`].
- Lifecycle/trigger:
  - Starts only after `PROC:gha-check-branch` completion and positive gate output.
  - Performs checkout, changelog generation, and release publication.
  - Exits after release action completes.
- Internal Call-Trace Tree:
  - No internal functions detected under `src/` or `.github/workflows`.
- External Boundaries:
  - `actions/checkout@v4` action execution [`.github/workflows/release-markdown.yml`].
  - `mikepenz/release-changelog-builder-action@v6` boundary [`.github/workflows/release-markdown.yml`].
  - `softprops/action-gh-release@v2` boundary [`.github/workflows/release-markdown.yml`].
- Thread Model:
  - no explicit threads detected.

## Communication Edges

- `EDGE:gha-check-branch->gha-build-release`
  - direction: `PROC:gha-check-branch -> PROC:gha-build-release`
  - mechanism: GitHub Actions job dependency (`needs`) + job output propagation
  - endpoint/channel: `needs.check-branch.outputs.is_master`
  - payload/data-shape: string enum (`"true" | "false"`) written via `$GITHUB_OUTPUT`
  - evidence: `.github/workflows/release-markdown.yml`
